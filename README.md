## Set Up (VSCode)
Note: I've already included the compiled CSS and JS modules in this branch. No need to perform any build steps if you already have these modules installed. Just make sure you indicate the correct paths in the source code.

- Make sure that you have Node.js installed in your system (https://nodejs.org/en)
- Open a new terminal inside VSCode
- To install Bootstrap v5.3.0 with the npm package, run `npm install bootstrap@5.3.0` in the terminal/command prompt

## Interface Libraries
- Bootstrap 5.3.0 - https://getbootstrap.com
